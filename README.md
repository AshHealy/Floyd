## What Have I Learned So Far

- Create the timer & Kill Buttons First
- Then Implement Behaviours
- Create a Button that starts the timer :I 
- The buttons should have been Styled Components
- Logic is chaotic and will bite you in the ass no matter what

## Notes and Questions To Ask Ben & Steve

- Can I refactor my App so that everthing is easier to style
- How can I save the game? Should I be able to save the game?

I've got a currency system that I want to implement. I think I want to build the shop using JSON objects.
